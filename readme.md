#  Preparing the release of People.ai Screensaver

## Prerequisites

1. Add notarization keys to keychain

    > xcrun notarytool store-credentials "AC_PASSWORD" --apple-id <apple_id> --team-id <team_id> --password <secret_2FA_password>

    Where replace <apple_id> with reald Apple ID, <team_id> with real Team ID and <secret_2FA_password> with real app password

## Build process

To build screensaver:
1. Run script
  > $  "./build.sh".

  It will build app, build installer package and sign it and produce **People.ia.signed.zip** package, that later can be send to notarisation.

## Notarisation

To notarize the screensaver:

1. Run script

  > $ "./notarize.sh".

  It may take up 10 minutes.

2. To add staple (required for Gatekeeper to check the app with no Internet connection available), run the following script:

  > $ "./add_staple.sh"
